This code consists of two files. The first file is the main program, and the second file contains the definition of the function ft_putchar. Let's break down what each part does:

Main Program (main.c):
This file includes "ft_putchar.c", indicating that it's going to use the code from the ft_putchar.c file.
It declares a function ft_putchar on line 3 without providing its implementation. This is called a function prototype, which tells the compiler that such a function exists and will be defined elsewhere.
In the main function (lines 5-8), it calls ft_putchar with the character 'Z'.


Function Definition (ft_putchar.c):
This file includes <unistd.h>, which provides access to the POSIX operating system API, including the write function.
It defines the function ft_putchar (lines 3-6). This function takes a single character c as an argument and writes it to the standard output (STDOUT) using the write function from the POSIX API. The write function writes nbytes of data from the buffer pointed to by buf to the file associated with the file descriptor fd.
In this case, write(1, &c, 1); writes the character c to standard output (file descriptor 1) with a buffer of size 1.

Overall, when the main program is executed, it will call the ft_putchar function with the character 'Z'. This function will then write the character 'Z' to the standard output. So, when you run this code, it will simply print the character 'Z' to the console.

In this example, char is the data type, and q is the variable name. When this function is called, it expects to receive a char value, which will be stored in the variable q for use within the function's body.

So, whenever you declare a function parameter in C, you should always include both the data type and the variable name.

In the expression write(1, &q, 1);, the number 1s are arguments to the write function, which is a system call in C used to write data to a file descriptor. Here's what each of these arguments represents:

File Descriptor (1): The first argument specifies the file descriptor to which the data will be written. In Unix-like operating systems, file descriptor 1 represents the standard output (stdout). So, writing to file descriptor 1 sends the data to the standard output, which is typically the terminal.
Buffer Address (&q): The second argument is a pointer to the buffer containing the data to be written. In this case, &q represents the address of the variable q or the character q if it's not a pointer. It's passing the address of the character q to the write function.
Number of Bytes (1): The third argument specifies the number of bytes to write from the buffer. In this case, it's 1, indicating that the function should write one byte of data starting from the address specified by &q. Since &q is the address of a single character, it will write that character.
So, overall, write(1, &q, 1); writes the character stored at the address of q to the standard output (terminal) by writing one byte of data.
